Features
--------
The implementation is by no means complete but the bulk of WF2
functionality has been written. The following features are *not* present
in the first release:

- support for IE5.x
- Repetition model
- Complex submission formats (no fancy XML stuff)
- datetime/datetime-local controls
- data loading
- output control
- labels collection
- fieldset extensions
- internationalisation

The remaining WF2 extensions have been implemented and should work as
expected. The Web Forms 2.0 spec is located on the WHATWG site:
